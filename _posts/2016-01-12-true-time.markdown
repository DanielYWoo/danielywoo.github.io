1. Leslie Lamport 1978 paper

2. Google Spanner

3. Cassandra concurrent writes
write(x, 1), write(x, 2), write(x, 3)
R=3, W=3, N=3

cassandra resolves conflicts with client timestamp, without the client timestamp the results could be
Node1:1, Node2:2, Node3:3

With client timestamp, we don't have linearizabilty but at least the 3 nodes are consistent. Timestamp is also used for replaying from hint writes. If client clock drifts too much, you will see writes out of real-time order. If we can limit client clock drifts to 200ms, it's good enough for non-critical writes (user nickname update, reply to a forum thread, etc).

if two writes occurs at the same time with the same timestamp, if value1 > value2, then value1 wins.
